# CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Token

**What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?**

- CSRF is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site when the user is authenticated.

- CSRF tokens prevent CSRF because without a token, an attacker cannot create valid requests to the backend server.
